# 🛵 Doordash Delivery Order Data Analysis

This is my first personal data analysis project. I explored the delivery data from Doordash to understand what factors affect customer ratings and how different cities, cuisines, and delivery times perform.

## 📊 Project Objective

- Explore delivery performance, customer satisfaction, and cuisine popularity on the Doordash platform.
- Find actionable insights to improve user satisfaction and platform efficiency.

## 🧰 Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Dataset Overview

- 11,000+ delivery records
- Fields include: city, cuisine, delivery time, delivery fee, review rating, etc.

## 🔍 Key Analysis Sections

1. **Top Cities by Order Count**  
   → Identified cities with highest order volume, plotted bar & pie charts.

2. **Delivery Time Distribution**  
   → Most orders are delivered in 25–35 mins; extreme cases visualized.

3. **Top Rated Restaurants & Cuisines**  
   → Filtered by count > 20; sorted by average review rating.

4. **Does Delivery Time or Speed Affect Ratings?**  
   → Used linear regression to explore relationships; found weak or no correlation.

5. **Insights and Suggestions**  
   → Fast delivery may not guarantee high rating; platform should also consider food quality and service.

## 📈 Sample Visualization

*(Insert a screenshot of your best graph, e.g. regression plot)*

## ✅ Conclusion

- High delivery speed doesn't significantly improve customer ratings.
- Some high-rated cuisines are underrepresented — marketing opportunity.
- Delivery time mostly falls in 25–35 mins, which is acceptable.
